### Read data and data management

We first import data into R.

#### Merging datafiles

We merge the 'paradata' file containing all sampled units with the 'survey responses' file.
In a real situation, there would also be a 'survey frame' dataset. This would be a third data file
from which the sample was selected. Ideally, the 'survey frame' would include all units from the 
population.

#### Filter variables 

We filter the variables that will be used for this example.



### Exploring the dataset
