## Introduction

### Note and bibliography 

This is a short guide that shows to weight a survey. It is intended to be a practical document and
intentionally avoids explaining complex or advanced methods. For more information you can check the 
following introductory texts:

  * Valliant et al (2013) *Practical Tools for Designing and Weighting Survey Samples*. New York: Springer Science+Business Media.
  * Lohr (2009) *Sampling: Design and Analysis*. 2nd Edition. Boston: Books/Cole.
  
And the book accompaining the R 'survey' package:  
  * Lumley (2010) *Complex Surveys: A Guide to Analysis Using R*. New Jersey: John Wiley & Sons Inc.

It is important to note that this guide focuses on surveys based on 'probability sample'.
These are surveys where all units in our statistical population have a chance of being selected
and the probability of selection is known to the researcher. 'Non-probability sample' methods
are diverse, more complex and usually rely on statistical modelling. 

### Basic steps in weighting a survey

Weighting is done to reduce survey bias. There are four basic steps in weighting. These are:

1. Computation of base/design weights.
2. 





### Read data and data management

We first import data into R.

#### Merging datafiles

We merge the 'paradata' file containing all sampled units with the 'survey responses' file.
In a real situation, there would also be a 'survey frame' dataset. This would be a third data file
from which the sample was selected. Ideally, the 'survey frame' would include all units from the 
population.

#### Filter variables 

We filter the variables that will be used for this example.
